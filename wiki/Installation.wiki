= Before You Begin =

The Dojo Toolkit Module requires that you are running Drupal 5.x. This module was developed and tested on Apache 2, PHP 5, and MySQL 5 in a Linux environment. It has not been tested on any other configuration, so consider yourself warned.

= Downloading the Module =

You can download the latest version from the [http://code.google.com/p/dojo-toolkit-module/downloads/list downloads page]. The file is a tar.gz archive and should be a snap to extract. To extract the file from the command line, run the following command:

{{{
tar -xvzf dojo_toolkit_module-5.x-X.X.tar.gz
}}}

Once you have extracted the archive, there will be a directory called "dojo". Put the "dojo" directory into the /sites/all/modules directory or /sites/<site name>/modules directory. You can also put in the /modules directory, but this is not recommended since it makes upgrading Drupal a pain.

= Enabling the Module =

Once the files are in place, log into Drupal and navigate to:

  * Administer > Site building > Modules

Scroll down to the "Other" modules section, click the "Dojo Toolkit" checkbox, then save the configuration.

= Installation Complete! Now what? =

For starters, take a tour of the instant benefits of the Dojo Module. Then you can dive into configuring the module to better suite your needs.
