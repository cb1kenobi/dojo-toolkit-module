= Overview =

The Dojo Toolkit Module is a Drupal module that enhances content, themes, and other modules.

With the Dojo Toolkit Module, you can add rich interaction to your Drupal site. Simply enabling the module gives you a snazzy rich text editor. How cool is that?

= Requirements =

The Dojo Toolkit Module requires Drupal 5.x, PHP 5.x, and <1MB of hard disk space. This module has only been tested in a Linux environment and probably won't run in a Windows environment.

= Upgrading =

Before upgrading, it is always a good idea to backup your site. If you are upgrading from 1.x, then it's probably best to rename the Dojo Toolkit Module directory and create a new one. Extract the Dojo Toolkit Module's files into the directory. Log into the administration area and go to:

  * Administer > Site building > Dojo Toolkit

Edit and re-save each build and editor profile. Hopefully in the next release you won't need to re-save the profiles.
