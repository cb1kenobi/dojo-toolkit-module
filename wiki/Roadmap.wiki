Unfortunately, this module is no longer actively being developed.  Here's some ideas for future additions:

  * Add support for Drupal 6
  * Add support for debug at all costs
  * Upgrading automatically migrates existing build/editor profiles
  * Add support for Dojo 1.2+
  * Add ability to put Dojo in non-module paths (i.e. the site root)
  * Add front-end for Dojo's build system
  * Add font and color commands to editor toolbar
  * Tie the editor's look into the theme's look (is this even worth it?)
