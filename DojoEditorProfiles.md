# The Default Editor Profile #

Just like the config profiles, you don't have to set up a config profile, but if you want to change the editor's visibility options, access roles, and toolbar commands, you will need to create an editor profile.

# Creating Your First Editor Profile #

Begin by clicking the "Add new editor profile" link. The editor profile is divided into a bunch of groups.

## General Information ##

Name the profile then select whether or not to show the toggle editor link and the default state. This is handy if you would like to force people to leave comments using only the editor.

## Access Roles ##

You must tie the profile to at least one access role. Since it's possible to associate more than one config profile to a single access role, you can use the handy Access Weight to influence which profile should be used.

## Visibility ##

You can control what pages the editor will or won't appear on. Additionally, you can specify the name of textarea's to ignore. Note that the textarea names are global, so if you have a textarea named message on two different pages, then they will both receive the same results.

## Toolbar ##

You can choose what toolbar buttons you want visible on pages that match this profile. You could set up a profile for comments pages were they only have some basic functions and then have another profile that provides all the buttons to authenticated users only.

Select a toolbar button, then click the add, remove or reorder buttons to manipulate the button.

After setting everything up, save the configuration and test!

# Setting Up Several Profiles #

Just like the config profiles, the editor profiles are flexible enough that you should be able to set up your system exactly the way you want it.
