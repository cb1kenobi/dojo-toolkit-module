The Dojo Toolkit Module integrates the [Dojo Javascript Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org) into a Drupal web application.  All jQuery dependent code on public facing pages has been re-written and extended in Dojo.  jQuery can then be excluded thus saving bandwidth and improves page load time.

The Dojo Toolkit Module includes a number of nice features including a rich-text editor on content creation pages.  There is a comprehensive administration area that allows you to create profiles for debugging and editor instances.

# Current Status #

While the Dojo Toolkit Module is amazing, it has become abandoned. I haven't had the time (or desire) to continue work on it.  The latest version is dated and written for Drupal 5.x and Dojo 1.0.

This project needs a new project lead, someone who cares enough to update it to the recent Drupal and Dojo releases.  If you think you're interested, please contact chris at cb1inc dot com and tell me you thoughts about this module and how you'd like to help.
