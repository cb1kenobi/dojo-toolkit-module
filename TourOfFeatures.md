# Supercharged Editing #

The Dojo Toolkit Module will replace the old boring with textarea fields with new boring textarea fields, but the new ones have a link to enable the Dojo rich text editor.

Enabling the editor will drop in the editor with a toolbar full of goodies to make entering content easier.

The editor can be customized by defining an editor profile which is discussed in the configuration section.

# Collapsible Panes #

In the spirit of removing the need for jQuery, the collapsible panes are now written using Dojo.

# Auto-complete Fields #

Finally, the auto-complete fields were rewritten to use Dojo's Ajax library.
Turning Off Dojo Form Elements

To keep the original jQuery form elements, you can uncheck the form elements on a per config profile basis.
